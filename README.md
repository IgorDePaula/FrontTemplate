FrontTemplate
=============

This is a basic front end Template with [less](http://lesscss.org/ "less"), [jade](http://jade-lang.com/ "jade") and [coffee script](http://coffeescript.org/ "coffee script") implemented on [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "grunt").

The tasks are automated with grunt to parse the scripts from source code to compressed files ready to use. Change the need paths relativo for your project.
