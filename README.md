FrontTemplate
=============

This is a basic front end Template with [less](http://lesscss.org/ "less"), [jade](http://jade-lang.com/ "jade") and [coffee script](http://coffeescript.org/ "coffee script") implemented on [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "grunt").

The tasks are automated with grunt to parse the scripts from source code to compressed files ready to use. Change the need paths relativo for your project in Grunfile.js, change the name, description and version of your project in package.json, and install all dependencies node with:

 `npm install`

And run grunt:

 `grunt`

The grunt watch all tasks for html, javascript and css files modifications.

Now have fun programming html, css and javascript.
